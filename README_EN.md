#### Scenes 1

As usual, Xiao Ming opened the Chrome browser to browse the BBS, Tieba. Accidentally, Xiaoming opened the advertisement on the web page and jumped to JingDong Mall. When he went to close the window subconsciously, he found that (OS: it was just the product I needed!) How would JD know?Now that I've opened it, let's see the details of the product! Not bad. ï¼ˆOS: Give it a try!)

#### Scenes 2

Bai listens to the netease cloud music daily recommended song list can not get out of it (OS: wow! Why the playlist full of my favorite music styles? How great the netease cloud music! Love it so much! I have to buy a mumbership), strolling through ZhiHu's "How elegant XXX?, "What kind of experience is XXX?, "How do you evaluate XXX? (OS: Huh? This question is just what I want to ask, it has already been asked! What?? Thousands of answers!! Go inside and have a look!)

#### Scenes 3

Xiao Da never forget to enrich himself at work. As the major technical cnblog, CSDN, OSChina, JianShu, JueJin, etc.,  he find the homepage content recommendation is great (OS: these technical net posts are so great. I don't have to look for it as it came out). When he open the blog home page unconsciously,he found  himself stick to write blog for three years, its technology stack is becoming more and more rich (OS: how to blog background does not provide a data analysis system? I want to see how many posts I've done over the years, when I've done it, which posts are hot, which technologies I've spent more time on, and which times I've been at my peak in the evenings? In the wee hours? I hope the system can give me more guidance data so that I can create better! Looking at the above scenes, you may sigh over the progress of technology, which has greatly improved our way of life. )

#### Idea

If you have a tool like this, it can help you get your personal information back, it can help you aggregate your personal information from various sites, it can help you analyze your personal data and give you Suggestions, it can help you visualize your personal data so that you can know yourself better.

> Would you need such a tool? Would you like such a tool?

Based on the above, I started to develop **[INFO-SPIDER](https://github.com/kangvcar/InfoSpider)** ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
